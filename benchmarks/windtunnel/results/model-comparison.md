# Model comparison

Two sections: the **current canonical board** (v1.2, regenerated from
`canonical/results.csv`) and a **historical snapshot** of the expansion runs as
they were measured at the time. Definitions match the README: infrastructure
rows excluded, success per attempt, tokens are total processed (uncached input
+ cache reads + cache writes + output), time is median agent time. Board
versions and what changed between them: [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Current canonical board (v1.2) — paired setups per model

### Majority-task success (current board)

| Interface | GPT-5.6 Luna | GPT-5.6 SOL | Gemini 3.6 Flash | Claude Opus 5 | GPT-6 Astra |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Computer use | 45/49 | 46/49 | 43/49 | 45/49 | 45/49 |
| WebMCP | 49/49 | 49/49 | 49/49 | 49/49 | 49/49 |

Code execution (GPT-6 Astra only): 49/49. Jev + Mercury 2.5: 49/49 with WebMCP; 25/49 with DOM controls.

### Tracked canonical cost (current board)

| Model | Paired setups tracked cost |
|---|---:|
| Jev + Mercury 2.5 (DOM controls + WebMCP) | $0.45 |
| GPT-5.6 Luna | $5.57 |
| GPT-5.6 SOL | $26.52 |
| Gemini 3.6 Flash | $6.39 |
| Claude Opus 5 | $34.37 |
| GPT-6 Astra | $70.02 |
| GPT-6 Astra incl. code execution | $105.55 |

### Takeaways (current board)

- Every native WebMCP configuration solves 49/49 tasks; Gemini 3.6 Flash and
  Claude Opus 5 pass all 147 attempts, Luna and Astra 146/147, SOL 145/147.
  Until v1.1 the Medusa checkout task capped every WebMCP row at 48/49 by
  construction (see the changelog).
- Jev + Mercury 2.5 leads the composite score with WebMCP at $0.0011 and 3.2s per median attempt. Its page setup costs less ($0.0008) but solves only 25/49 tasks. These use different harnesses; the comparison does not isolate the interface. Unknown usage and excluded infrastructure costs are listed in the [release provenance](2026-09-18-jev-mercury/PROVENANCE.md).
- Computer use tops out at 91.8% attempt success (GPT-6 Astra); no
  screenshot configuration solves more than 46/49 tasks. Turn-cap hits on the
  screenshot arms: GPT-5.6 Luna 11, GPT-5.6 SOL 12, Gemini 3.6 Flash 22, Claude Opus 5 27, GPT-6 Astra 11.
- Astra is the first model measured with OpenAI's code-execution interface
  alongside screenshots and WebMCP. Its screenshot row is the most expensive on
  the board ($0.261 per median attempt — roughly 2× SOL's input price and 1.7×
  its output price, more turns per task, and cache reads on only 1 of 147
  attempts) for a mid-pack 45/49.
- OpenAI's recommended code-execution mode is the strongest screen-driving
  result measured here: 147/147 attempts and 49/49 tasks at $0.119 and 16.4s.
  Same model, same tasks, native WebMCP is 6.9× cheaper, 4.3× lighter and
  2.6× faster at the same 49/49.
- Astra was the most expensive model to measure: $105.55 across its three arms
  (computer use $66.69, code execution $35.53, WebMCP $3.33).

## Historical snapshot — expansion runs as measured at the time

These are the numbers recorded when each model was added (GPT-5.5 reference
run of 2026-07-27; Luna, SOL, Gemini and Opus expansion runs of August 2026).
They predate the 2026-08-20 scorer corrections and board v1.1, and use the
older token definition (input + cached input + output). They are kept for the
record and are **not** the current board.

| Interface | Model / run | Attempt success | Median cost / task | Median tokens / task | Median agent time / task |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Computer use | GPT-5.5 reference | 90.3% (131/145) | $0.090 | 18,659 | 20.4s |
| Computer use | GPT-5.6 Luna (Phase 1) | 83.0% (122/147) | $0.017 | 20,914 | 18.3s |
| Computer use | GPT-5.6 SOL | 83.7% (123/147) | $0.063 | 16,312 | 25.1s |
| Computer use | Gemini 3.6 Flash | 78.9% (116/147) | $0.020 | 23,658 | 33.7s |
| Computer use | Claude Opus 5 | 86.4% (127/147) | $0.139 | 47,141 | 50.4s |
| WebMCP | GPT-5.5 reference | 93.2% (137/147) | $0.015 | 2,546 | 5.8s |
| WebMCP | GPT-5.6 Luna (Phase 1) | 93.2% (137/147) | $0.002 | 2,596 | 5.7s |
| WebMCP | GPT-5.6 SOL (Phase 2) | 93.9% (138/147) | $0.013 | 2,573 | 9.4s |
| WebMCP | Gemini 3.6 Flash | 96.6% (142/147) | $0.004 | 4,460 | 7.8s |
| WebMCP | Claude Opus 5 | 96.6% (142/147) | $0.014 | 4,871 | 9.9s |

All model-expansion rows use the canonical 600-second per-attempt cap. The SOL
row replaces the attempts that reached the previous cap with their targeted
600-second reruns; see `2026-08-17-sol-600-timeouts/PROVENANCE.md`.

## Majority-task success

| Interface | GPT-5.5 reference | GPT-5.6 Luna | GPT-5.6 SOL | Gemini 3.6 Flash | Claude Opus 5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Computer use | 44/49 (89.8%) | 41/49 (83.7%) | 42/49 (85.7%) | 38/49 (77.6%) | 43/49 (87.8%) |
| WebMCP | 47/49 (95.9%) | 46/49 (93.9%) | 46/49 (93.9%) | 47/49 (95.9%) | 48/49 (98.0%) |


## Tracked run cost

| Run | Tracked canonical cost |
|---|---:|
| GPT-5.6 Luna | $6.3644 |
| GPT-5.6 SOL | $32.4690 |
| Gemini 3.6 Flash | $6.7573 |
| Claude Opus 5 | $34.6716 |

The SOL total is the canonical substitution dataset. It excludes discarded
partial attempts that are not part of the benchmark result.
