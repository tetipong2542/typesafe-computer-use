## Notes (operator)

Targeted re-run of the two `cu-openai × gpt-6-astra` sites the main flight (`2026-09-05-astra-full`) lost: learnhouse (stale runtime dir from a killed earlier attempt) and hi-events (capsule app container died mid-batch; teardown hung; batch rows dropped). Fresh capsules, same harness commit as the main flight plus the capsule-timeout fixes. All 51 rows valid; combined-explorer takes these cells over the main flight's (which has none for them).
