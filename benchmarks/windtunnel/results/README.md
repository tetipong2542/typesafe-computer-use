# Results

Finished benchmark runs live here. Each run is one folder, and each folder has
a short Markdown report as its front page.

**The current reference is [`canonical/`](canonical/)** — board v1.2, 21
configurations × 49 tasks × 3 attempts, consolidated per cell from the source
runs listed in its [`PROVENANCE.md`](canonical/PROVENANCE.md). Open its
`explorer.html` for the interactive view; `results.csv` / `run.json` carry
every attempt's metrics and redacted final answer. The [Jev release](2026-09-18-jev-mercury/PROVENANCE.md) also contains redacted transcripts for all 294 attempts. The original seven-method run
is [`2026-07-27-reference/`](2026-07-27-reference/).

**The cross-model view is [`model-comparison.md`](model-comparison.md).** It
includes Jev + Mercury 2.5 with WebMCP and ultrafast DOM controls, alongside the paired computer-use and WebMCP arms for GPT-5.5, GPT-5.6 Luna,
GPT-5.6 SOL, Gemini 3.6 Flash, Claude Opus 5, and GPT-6 Astra (plus Astra's
code-execution arm) under the canonical 600-second per-attempt cap. Board
versions and what changed between them: [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Layout

```
results/
  YYYY-MM-DD-<label>/     one run (e.g. 2026-07-21-lite-smoke)
    report.md            the readable summary — start here
    explorer.html        interactive per-run explorer
    PROVENANCE.md        merge/source notes when a reference run has them
    results.csv          one row per task attempt (times, tokens, cost, verdict)
    run.json             the full run record: options, capsules, rows, verdicts
```

Use a dated folder name so runs sort chronologically and never collide:
`2026-07-21-full-reference`, `2026-07-22-medusa-perturbed`, and so on.

## Writing a report

Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) to `<your-run>/report.md` and fill it in.
The template is short on purpose — the goal is that anyone can read one report
and understand what was tested, what won, and how to reproduce it.

## Reading a report

The headline is **solved / total** for each access method — how many tasks each
of the four interfaces completed. A task is "solved" when it passes on most
repeat attempts. Higher is better; the interesting part is the *gap* between
the interfaces on the same tasks.
