# WindTunnel

**Benchmark WebMCP against other methods browser agents use to interact with websites.**

**WebMCP solves 100% of tasks, with 2.5–7.5× faster median execution, 3–47× lower median cost, and 27–50% higher scores than the median of other methods.**

**WindTunnel compares WebMCP with other ways browser agents interact with
websites.** It runs the same tasks on the same sites and measures success rate,
execution time, token usage, and cost.

## Quick start

Just want the results? [Jump to them.](#results)

Run the harness for free (Node 20.11+, no key, no Docker):

```bash
npm ci
WT_FAKE_LIFECYCLE=1 npm run bench    # no LLM — scores 0/7 by design, just proves it runs
```

Run the real benchmark — needs Docker, Linux or macOS, and a key
([setup](#running-it-yourself)):

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
npm run bench -- --arms wm-claude,cu-claude --budget 2
```

Runs the 7 tasks on the three lightweight sites once each, same model on two
interfaces — WebMCP against screenshots. 14 attempts, well under $1; `--budget`
stops launching further attempts once accumulated spend exceeds it.

## Background: Four ways to operate a website

A browser agent can operate a website through four main interfaces:

1. **Screenshots (computer use)** — it reads rendered images of the page and
   acts by coordinate.
2. **Page structure** — it reads the page's DOM and accessibility tree.
3. **Code execution** — the model writes browser-automation code (Playwright)
   that reads and drives the page; OpenAI's recommended mode for GPT-6 Astra.
4. **WebMCP** — the website exposes direct actions (`add_to_cart(id)`,
   `book_slot(time)`) for the agent to call.
   ([What is WebMCP?](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmcp))

## Results

**Canonical board v1.2: 2026-09-18** — 21 configurations × 49 tasks across 8
sites × 3 attempts = **3,087 attempt rows** and **1,029 majority verdicts**, with
a 600s per-attempt cap. What changed since v1.1: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**Ten configurations solve 49/49 tasks:** all nine WebMCP configurations and
GPT-6 Astra on code execution, OpenAI's recommended computer-use mode. Raw
task-solve rate therefore does not separate WebMCP from the best screen-driving
configuration; cost and time do.

**New: Jev + Mercury 2.5** solves **49/49 tasks with WebMCP** and **25/49 with ultrafast DOM controls**, without WebMCP. WebMCP leads the composite score and is 1.7× faster for this pair. The page setup costs less per median attempt ($0.0008 vs. $0.0011), but succeeds less often.

**Five configurations pass every attempt (147/147):** Gemini 3.6 Flash,
Sonnet 5 (native and Stagehand v4) and Claude Opus 5 via WebMCP, and GPT-6
Astra via code execution. For the same model, Astra's code-execution attempts
cost **$35.53 total vs. $3.33** for native WebMCP (10.7×), while
median agent time was **16.4s vs. 6.3s**.

<sub>Attempts are successful attempts out of 147; Turn-cap counts attempts
that used every turn of their model-turn budget (whether or not the final turn
produced an answer). Medians are rounded by the chart generator (JavaScript
`toFixed`; an exact 6.85 s prints as 6.8 s). Median tokens are total processed:
uncached input + cache reads + cache writes + output. The table reports tasks
solved by a majority of three attempts; infrastructure rows are excluded.</sub>

<sub>Headline ranges compare each WebMCP configuration with the median of all
non-WebMCP configurations: 24.03s, $0.05024, and a composite score of 64.4.
Each configuration has equal weight; time and cost include failed attempts.</sub>

**Turn budgets are a material separator.** None of the **1,323 WebMCP
attempts** hit the turn budget, versus **211 of 1,764 screen-driving attempts**.
Matched like-for-like — each model's native WebMCP run against its own
computer-use run, 882 attempts per side — the count is **0 vs. 124**. The
screen-driving arms are given roughly 3× larger budgets because a screenshot
agent needs about three model turns per journey step.

**Model snapshot reporting has a harness limitation.** Stagehand and
browser-use cannot report the exact model snapshot they were served, so those
rows use `snapshot_source: unavailable:<harness>`. The configured model is
confirmed out of band with [`scripts/verify-model.mjs`](scripts/verify-model.mjs).

### How the advantage scales with journey length

The following table covers the six native WebMCP/screenshot model pairs; it excludes Jev's page-control setup.

| Tier | Tasks | WebMCP solved | Computer use solved | Cheaper | Faster | Lighter |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Answer (1–2 steps) | 21 | 126/126 | 107/126 | 6.0× | 3.5× | 6.0× |
| Action, short (3–5) | 16 | 96/96 | 87/96 | 6.4× | 3.3× | 5.6× |
| **Action, long (6–10)** | 8 | **48/48** | **47/48** | **11.5×** | **5.2×** | **11.2×** |
| **Sensitive action (8–15)** | 4 | **24/24** | **22/24** | **12.7×** | **7.8×** | **12.7×** |

**On long journeys the efficiency gap widens sharply.** Across the 12 long and
sensitive-action tasks, WebMCP solved **72/72 model-task cells** vs. computer
use's **69/72 (96%)**, using **12.3× lower cost**, **5.8× less agent time**, and
**13.0× fewer tokens**. Until board v1.1 the sensitive-action row was a
deliberate coverage boundary: the store's WebMCP tools handed guest checkout
back to the page before the final purchase (task `md-8`), so no WebMCP
configuration could complete it while screen-driving agents could. v1.1 added a
`complete_checkout` tool and re-measured that cell — see
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

<sub>How these numbers are computed: [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md).</sub>

## How it works

Every task runs on the same site, from the same seeded state, scored by the
same check, for every method — so a difference in outcome isn't the site or the
data. What differs is the whole method configuration: interface, model,
framework, and turn budget.

- **Real, self-hosted applications.** Production open-source apps, not
  synthetic pages. Each runs locally in Docker, pinned to a fixed version.
- **Outcome-based scoring.** No human or model judges a run: WindTunnel
  inspects the resulting application state — is the item in the cart, does the
  appointment exist — and records pass or fail, plus what the attempt cost.
- **Integrity.** Checked values are generated fresh from a seed, state-changing
  tasks are scored by inspecting the application, and published final answers are redacted. The Jev release includes
  [redacted transcripts](results/2026-09-18-jev-mercury/PROVENANCE.md); the combined result rows stay compact. Memorization risk and its limits:
  [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md).
- **Scorer correction.** Independent review found that the canonical merge had
  been built before corrected predicates were applied. Re-scoring fixed 19
  false negatives — 19 promotions and 0 demotions — and the corrected rows are
  marked in the canonical CSV.

## The sites

Eight applications across public and authenticated pages and different stacks —
six live targets, two read-only controls.

| Site | Type | Pulled from (upstream) | Exercises |
|---|---|---|---|
| nextjs-starter-medusa | online store | [medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa) | browse → cart → checkout |
| hi-events | events / ticketing | [HiEventsDev/Hi.Events](https://github.com/HiEventsDev/Hi.Events) | browse → ticket checkout |
| easyappointments | appointment booking | [alextselegidis/easyappointments](https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments) | booking; admin (auth) |
| learnhouse | course platform | [learnhouse/learnhouse](https://github.com/learnhouse/learnhouse) | catalog; authoring (auth) |
| idurar-erp-crm | B2B CRM | [idurar/idurar-erp-crm](https://github.com/idurar/idurar-erp-crm) | record CRUD (auth) |
| directory-9d8 | business directory | [9d8dev/directory](https://github.com/9d8dev/directory) | search / filter |
| tailwind-nextjs-blog | blog (control) | [timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) | read-only content |
| bulletproof-react | web app (control) | [alan2207/bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) | read-only; auth |

## The tasks

49 benchmark tasks across the eight sites, plus 10 calibration tasks for cost
measurement. Four difficulty tiers by journey length:

| Tier | Steps | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Answer | 1–2 | "What is the price of X?" |
| Action (short) | 3–5 | "Add two of X to the cart." |
| Action (long) | 6–10 | "File a ticket, assign it, set its priority from the report." |
| Sensitive action | 8–15 | "Book the cheapest available slot and confirm." |

Each task is attempted N times (3 by default). A task is **solved** when a
majority of attempts pass; the headline is solved ÷ total, reported next to
median time, tokens, and cost.

Each task also carries a per-interface turn budget — a screenshot agent needs
~3 turns per step, a tool-calling agent ~1 (defaults: [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md)).

## The methods

The board spans 13 implementations and 21 configurations: nine with WebMCP
and twelve using screenshots, page structure, or code execution. Models include
Sonnet 5, Opus 5, GPT-5.6 Luna, GPT-5.6 SOL, GPT-6 Astra, Gemini 3.6 Flash,
and Jev + Mercury 2.5. Every configuration uses the same 49 tasks and scoring.

Jev makes decisions; Mercury writes arguments or field values and the final answer.
The WebMCP and ultrafast page setups use separate frozen harnesses, so this is a
comparison of complete setups. Their [runner code and run instructions](experiments/jev/README.md) are published separately from the standard CLI.
[Versions, accounting and redacted transcripts](results/2026-09-18-jev-mercury/PROVENANCE.md).

## Cost

**Where the tokens go.** How much an agent reads each turn is set by the
interface:

- **Screenshots (computer use)** — a full page *image* every turn: thousands of
  tokens each, refreshed nearly every step.
- **Page structure (DOM / accessibility tree)** — the page's *text* every turn,
  the whole page re-read each step. DOM + vision sends the text *and* a
  screenshot, and is often the heaviest configuration of all.
- **WebMCP** — a short list of tool schemas plus small JSON results. No page
  text, no screenshots. Usually less context.

**Task length multiplies it.** Page-reading interfaces grow fastest because
they re-read the page each step. Across the native model pairs, WebMCP's median
cost advantage grows from about 6× on short tasks to 11–13× on longer journeys.

**Per-task medians** across the current 21-configuration leaderboard (tokens
include cache reads and cache writes; pricing detail in
[`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md)):

| Interface | Configurations | Median tokens / task | Median cost / task |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| WebMCP | 9 | 2,573–9,793 | $0.0011–$0.017 |
| DOM (ultrafast) | 1 | 13,892 | $0.0008 |
| Computer use | 6 | 16,235–57,701 | $0.017–$0.261 |
| Code execution | 1 | 10,982 | $0.119 |
| Accessibility tree | 2 | 10,762–18,517 | $0.020–$0.038 |
| DOM + vision | 2 | 29,561–64,424 | $0.033–$0.210 |

**PROJECTED cost per 1,000 task attempts** — extrapolated from the 147 observed
attempts in each configuration, not an observed 1,000-run experiment:

| Interface | Range | Median |
|---|---:|---:|
| WebMCP | $1.37–$22.67 | $10.65 |
| Screen-driving | $1.67–$453.68 | $120.01 |

These ranges overlap. Costs use reported usage; unknown usage and excluded infrastructure spend for the new setups are disclosed in their provenance.

**What a run costs:**

| Run | Scope | Ballpark |
|---|---|---:|
| quick check | `--preset smoke --sites lite` — 3 light sites, 1 attempt each | under $1 |
| small | `--preset lite --sites lite` — the lite task set × 3 attempts | $5–10 |
| full paired model (measured additions) | all 8 sites, 49 tasks × 3 attempts × WebMCP + computer use | ~$6–70 |
| full canonical leaderboard (measured) | all 8 sites, 49 tasks × 3 attempts × 21 configurations | $281.80 |

In the former 2026-07-27 reference flight, the three WebMCP methods were ~9%
of the bill; historical breakdown:
[docs/CALIBRATION.md](docs/CALIBRATION.md).

**Spending less.** The levers, cheapest first:

- **Fewer sites** — `--sites lite` (3 lightweight sites, no databases).
- **Fewer / cheaper methods** — WebMCP medians are $0.0011–$0.017/task;
  computer use and DOM + vision carry most of the cost.
- **Fewer attempts** — `--preset smoke` or `--n 1` instead of the default 3
  (you lose majority voting, so one run decides each task).

## Running it yourself

**Setup.** You need Docker, Node 20.11+, and an API key for the model under test:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium                       # browser for the agents (or set WT_CHROME)
python3 -m venv .venv-browseruse \
  && .venv-browseruse/bin/pip install browser-use==0.12.7   # only for the dom-browseruse method
```

Real site boots use Linux-oriented capsule tooling. Native Linux is the
lowest-overhead host; macOS works through Docker Desktop when GNU tar and
coreutils are installed and placed first on `PATH` (`brew install gnu-tar
coreutils`). Docker Desktop's VM and filesystem layer add boot/reset and
wall-clock overhead, so report the host and avoid comparing absolute latency
with bare-metal Linux. You can also dry-run the pipeline
(`WT_FAKE_LIFECYCLE=1`) or point it at a site you booted yourself
(`WT_MANUAL_BASEURL=http://localhost:PORT`).

**Site profiles** size the run to the machine at hand:

| profile | sites | needs | runs on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lite` | 3 lightweight sites, no databases | Node | laptop, CI |
| `core` | `lite` + the online store | + Postgres | 8 GB laptop |
| `categories` | one site per category | mixed | 16 GB machine |
| `full` | all 8 sites | all stacks | 16 GB+ worker |

**Commands.** `--arms` picks the methods; the default (`scripted`) is a free,
no-LLM baseline that only exercises the pipeline:

```bash
npm run bench -- --preset smoke --sites lite --arms scripted    # free pipeline check, no API key
npm run bench -- --preset smoke --sites lite --arms wm-claude,cu-claude   # cheapest paid run, 1 attempt per task
npm run bench -- --preset lite --sites lite --arms wm-claude,cu-claude,dom-browseruse,a11y-stagehand   # every task on the three lite sites × 3 attempts
npm run bench -- --preset smoke --sites lite --arms wm-claude --seed 7 --budget 2 --label check
npm run bench -- --preset smoke --sites idurar-erp-crm --arms cu-openai --task-ids id-6,id-6,id-8 --n 1
```

**Keys.** Runs read the provider key straight from your environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # cu-claude, dom-browseruse, a11y-stagehand, wm-claude, wm-stagehand
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # cu-openai, wm-gpt, code-openai
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...             # cu-gemini, wm-gemini
export WT_SECRET=...                  # optional capsule secret
export WT_SECRET_KEY=...              # optional key used to protect it
```

A method whose key is absent is skipped with a notice, never an error.
`--task-ids` selects exact task IDs; repeated IDs intentionally repeat a task,
which is useful for targeted diagnostics.

**Switching models.** `--model <method>=<model>` overrides the model for one
method:

```bash
npm run bench -- --preset lite --sites lite --arms wm-claude --model wm-claude=claude-opus-5
npm run bench -- --preset smoke --sites lite --arms cu-openai,wm-gpt,code-openai --model cu-openai=gpt-6-astra --model wm-gpt=gpt-6-astra --model code-openai=gpt-6-astra
```

Computer use needs a computer-use-capable model. Switching provider takes that
provider's own method and key, not just a model name.
